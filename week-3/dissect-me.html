      You may have heard of Git and Github. The two are intertwined within the developer community. It allows developers to develop programs without the fear of losing their work. It also helps them keep track of changes that are made on the projects they’re working on. Perhaps the biggest advantage to using Git and GitHub is that it allows multiple people to work on a project at the same time without the fear of messing up other people’s work.

        First let’s start with the Git. Git is a type of version control software. This particular software allows a person to work on files and save them with the ability to go back to an older version. It’s like going back in time. You can keep track of all these changes using some of the tools built into Git.

        GitHub although has the Git in it’s name is a completely different program. It is an online storage space to collect all of your files that you’ve changed with Git online. This allows you to access the files anywhere like dropbox or Google drive. Just like these cloud services, you can let other people view your GitHub collection, called repositories and make changes. This is a very powerful concept. Imagine having the task of creating a video game with 3 people. With GitHub you could have one person work on menus, the other on levels, and the other on sound. GitHub lets them upload their work and have the others review it before putting it in the game. If they needed to take a part of it out, say a level that isn’t working they could do that by reverting to an older version that didn’t include that level.

  Perhaps there will be an intro post sometime later... but for now, we're going to dive right in. I'll be writing a bit about my experiences with git, GitHub, and the command line, which were the core parts of the curriculum for DBC this first week of Phase 0.
  </p>
  <p>
  The big theme for this week was that previous exposure to the concepts helped them really sink in this time around. I suspect that will be a recurring pattern through DBC - it may take a few rehearsals before something really becomes intuitive. I think that's actually a pretty fundamental part of learning that I try to weasel my way out of sometimes, but in the end, there is no substitute for practice, or as my boss likes to say, "additional reps." I actually think it's an encouraging sign, very much aligne d with growth-mindset thinking: there is no concept you can't understand as long as you keep at it.

  I had been exposed to all three topics previously in my CS adventures, both through chance encounters and through my deliberate attempts to learn them. I've been through at least one mini-CLI course, and I'd read a few git/GitHub tutorials previously. I knew these were fundamental tools in the developer toolkit, but like foreign languages, they don't stick when you don't feel you have a need to use them. Why use version control when you're building small programs that don't play together? Why bother with a command line interface when I have a perfectly good GUI? And I think I could still defend that line of reasoning - the average person probably doesn't need to know the ins and outs of rmdir - but it's certainly the case that I'll need to know them soon.

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

Article seems to be very popular in the twitterized/syndicated web 2.0 world. Some kind of header and footer are natural as well. We didn't use aside or nav, though I feel like I tend to gravitate toward them as well.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

So head elements don't get displayed. But they are processed first since they inform the content in the body. After that, elements are generally displayed from top to bottom.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I got the sense that sublime is an incredibly flexible tool if you are willing to get under the hood. I've already done a little exploring in terms of different user settings, but the snippets were new. And I love that kind of tool - I will definitely be making lots of snippets.

I was doing shortcut foo for a while in Sublime! I stopped when I felt like I learned some of the most important ones, but I'll probably continue to revisit as I go. Frankly, I'm disappointed in Mac shortcuts after working in Office 2013 for the last few years - Office has tremendous shortcut support so that you can do almost anything with your keyboard without actually knowing the sequence in advance. I'm frustrated by needing to memorize the Mac sequences, even if they save time.
