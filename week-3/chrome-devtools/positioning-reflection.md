#How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

The inspector allows you to play around with HTML and CSS "real-time" so that you can see how different changes to the HTML/CSS impact the presentation in the browser.

#How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

You can set the height and width properties for elements, or in some cases, change the display value (e.g. changing from inline to block changes the default width)

#What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

*Static - objects appear in browser as they would have based only on the HTML
*Relative - shifts an element relative to where it would normally be, though the original spot where the element would have been is maintained
*Fixed - elements stay in the same position in the browser regardless of scrolling.
*Absolute - elements are positioned relative to the nearest parent element with a relative or absolute position

#What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?

It's easiest to understand by starting with the content as the innermost layer. Padding goes between the content and the border. The border goes between the padding and the margin. And the margin is the invisible part that gives some separation from other elements.

#What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

I thought this was a nice pairing opportunity - it was useful to have someone to bounce thoughts off of. But, I wish that some of the questions had been harder toward the end so that we could really test the limits of our knowledge. And related to that, the more the things we're modeling represent real things we might need to do as part of a normal website, the better - the sidebar, header, and footer challenges were especially useful.
