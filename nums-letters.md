#Release 1

##What does puts do?

puts returns nil and prints the output to the console with a new line

##What is an integer? What is a float?

Integers - whole numbers (pos or neg) without a decimal point
Floats - numbers with decimal points

##What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Float division is similar to the normal division that you already know (and in this case, the answer will always have a decimal point even if it's a whole number). Integer division is like float/normal division, except at the end, you round down to the next integer.


Hours in a year:
```
24 * 365
```

Minutes in a decade:
```
60 * 24 * 365 * 10
```

#Release 7

##How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

Ruby follows normal rules for calculation (please excuse my dear aunt sally: parentheses exponents multiplication division addition subtraction). Floats and integers are treated differently. Certain operations also translate over to strings, where addition will concatenate two strings.

##What is the difference between integers and floats?

Both are kinds of numbers. Integers - no decimals. Float - have decimals.

##What is the difference between integer and float division?

Float division is similar to the normal division that you already know (and in this case, the answer will always have a decimal point even if it's a whole number). Integer division is like float/normal division, except at the end, you round down to the next integer.

##What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

String are collections or groups of characters (including symbols, letters, numbers, etc.). You use them for all sorts of purposes, like writing your answer to a reflection question.

##What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

Local variables are those used in a particular method or subroutine (as opposed to global variables which exist across methods). You might use them if you needed a variable to exist only while a method was being executed, but didn't need it after that.

##How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

Sorry, I thought it was not engaging enough. I learned basic Ruby prior to DBC and so the interview was my refresher course. I wish there were more opportunities to go deeper.
