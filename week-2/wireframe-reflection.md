##What is a wireframe?

A wireframe is a visual representation of a website in its simplest, structural form. It shows the different basic components of a website and how they are arranged.

##What are the benefits of wireframing?

Wireframing is similar to outlining a paper before you begin. It helps you organize your thoughts and create a better design for your page. Ultimately, if a user can't interact with your site via wireframe, it's a sign that you should revisit the organization and design of the page.

##Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

I had a lot of trouble with this - partly because I found the free tool I started to explore, Cacoo, not user-friendly at all. There were some very basic ideas that didn't seem to work - like adding borders to text boxes. I have actually wireframed other sites before (I just didn't know it was called that!) and know that I enjoy it under the right circumstances.

##Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I largely stuck with the first idea. But with a bit more time, I'll probably play around with a number of different possibilities.

##What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

What are good free wireframing tools? I found Cacoo, though I will revisit if I get time because I was not impressed. There is also a question as to what is the easiest way to get the information/ideas out there - if I had to try it again, I'd probably just draw it on paper and take a picture with my phone.

##Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

I liked the markdown file part - I'm getting comfortable with making those, embedding images, etc. And also getting more fluent with the terminal. As I've already noted, I didn't love the wireframing part, though I will experiment with more mediums and approaches if I have time this week.
