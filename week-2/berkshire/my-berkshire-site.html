- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

I had a great time! It is cool to find that you can replicate most of the content of a site owned by one of the richest people in the world on your own computer in your bedroom.

I feel like my pair and I were very good with populating the content; in retrospect, we didn't push as far as we could have with the semantic aspects. So I went back afterward to do some of that.

Generally, I didn't experience major problems with putting the HTML into the actual site, though I achieve major clarity around relative path (that I thought I'd figured out before, but was wrong...)

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

Didn't do as much during the pair as I would have liked. But I totally understand the importance and the usefulness of these improved distinctions in HTML5. I do think the article vs. section distinction is still confusing, though it sounds like I'm not alone in thinking that.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

It's tough in that we wanted to make the page look as much like the real version as we could (with some limits). We steered clear of tables, which makes sense because even though the BH website looks like a table of links, it's just an unordered list. I did type in ALL CAPS in some cases, which is probably not best practice, I did use the strong tag to bold some things, and we used the <br> tag for line breaks, which is probably doable in other ways. But generally we were focused on structure here.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

It's hard to have zero formatting when you're vetting your output... and the idea that structure and formatting can exist completely independently is wishful thinking from the perspective of human psychology and perception. The styling we put on fundamentally changes the way people interact with our websites. That said, I do like the idea of HTML as providing an outline that is much more machine-accessible - I can imagine how in the world of big data, that's a huge advantage.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

-Use the autocomplete as much as you can and look out for closing tags.
-Use copy/paste A LOT.
-During and after you write it, think about how someone who could only see the HTML (a script, perhaps), would create an outline of your page and see if it makes sense.
-Be ready to research new stuff! We learned about the <br> tag together.
