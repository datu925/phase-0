#1.1 Think About Time Reflection

Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?
Getting Things Done
Timeboxing/the Pomodoro Technique
What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?
Time boxing is giving yourself a set window of time - for instance, 1 hour) to work on a task and reevaluating progress and next steps (i.e. whether you should continue to work on it, and how) at the end of that window. That’s in contrast to simply working on a task until it’s done
It feels like the time boxing approach has two advantages. First, people tend to work with greater focus and intensity when they are trying to maximize the amount of output in a given time limit. Somehow, “do this task as quickly as you can” isn’t as powerful as, “do as much work as you can in 25 minutes.”
Second, it’s helpful to build reevaluating and renegotiating your task list into the structure of your time management system, and time boxing forces you to do that. Theoretically, you could do this anyway in the “task completion” approach, but you just have to continually ask yourself the question “am I making the right kind of progress? Should my work for the next [fill in time interval] look like my work over the last [time interval]? Do I need to keep doing this?” It may be hard to remember to do that, so time boxing has an advantage there.
How do you manage your time currently?
I make to-do lists. At work, I do this essentially as needed. At home, I have an email-based system. My approach is generally inspired by David Allen’s Getting Things Done. Everything either ends up on a Next Actions list, something to be done later, or something to be nixed/deleted. But my fidelity isn’t great.
Once I have my list, it’s usually fairly intuitive to figure out which things to do first, based on dependencies, priority, or the context of my work situation (e.g. am I in a good position to make phone calls?).
Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?
Mostly. Again, my fidelity isn’t great. But I find I’m able to track all of the things I want to do and do them when I have time. I haven’t played around with anything that would increase my intensity/energy (maybe timeboxing). The other evolution I’ve been thinking about a lot recently is prioritization - that is, choosing what’s most important to work on and eliminating the less-important things on one’s list. It’s easier to make a to-do list and check off your items, but did you have the right things on that list in the first place? That’s tough.
Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?
I’m game to try the pomodoro technique in certain circumstances. Probably in combination with a daily plan where I lay out how many hours I think something will take. That way it’s easier to figure out if you’re meeting your targets or not.
What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?
At the beginning of the week, read through all of the required components of the work (including bonus). Create rough time estimates for each one. Look at my evenings and weekend and determine when I need to be working.
For each task, work on it to completion, but then reevaluate that whenever I hit 50%, 75%, and 100% of my time estimate. Consider at each step whether I need to do that task in a different kind of way - either a different process or a different level of quality (for instance, I tend to spend a long time on the reflections because I like journaling, but too much reflection doesn’t add much value).
Experiment with the pomodoro technique for 1-2 tasks per week, to see if you like it.

#1.2 The Command Line Reflection

What is a shell? What is “bash?"
In my own words, a shell is a window for the user to directly interact with computer processes and data. We’ve been talking about doing that via command line interface, though graphical user interfaces also count. Bash is Unix’s default version of the shell/command line.
What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
I think I understand the difference between <, >, and | for the most part, although it’s hard to tell if there are two or more ways of writing the same command (e.g. one way to write it using < and one way to write it using |).
Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
I think so! Though it feels like we are looking at the tip of the iceberg. There are so many options for each command that do different things that feel like it will take a long time to really get comfortable.
In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?
cd, ls, rm, cp for directory/file management.
Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.
-pwd - print working directory. Gives the path for the directory you’re currently in
-ls - list file & folders in a directory (default is working directory)
-mv - move file or folder to a different directory, or rename a file/folder
-cd - change directory
-../ - one directory-level up from working directory
-touch - create a file
-mkdir - create a folder/directory
-less - page through a file. Spacebar/down arrow is down, w/up arrow is up.
-rmdir - remove/delete a directory
-rm - remove/delete a file
-help - for Unix, “man” is equivalent. Show the help or manual page for a particular command.
